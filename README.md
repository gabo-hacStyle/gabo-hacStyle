## 👨‍💻 Projects

Here you can see some of my favorite projects I have worked on! 

1. **📚Academic Platform:** This application is designed to manage courses, students, and users as an academic manager in an institution. It uses localStorage. Admin can create, edit, and delete endpoints. [See more](https://academic-platform.vercel.app/) | [See repo](https://github.com/gabo-hacStyle/academic-platform)
2. **📰 Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard for e-commerce. Its features can help you visualize data in a very practical way. Of course, is also responsive and supports light/dark themes. The application was built using React, ViteJS, and Tailwind CSS for styling. [See more](https://dashboard-app-psi-vert.vercel.app/) | [See repo](https://github.com/gabo-hacStyle/dashboard-app) 
3. **👨🏻‍⚖️ Login/Register & Dashboard API:** Backend built with django and django-rest-framework. Authentication and registration services for users have already been implemented. In this API, the data is auto-generated in the backend --> according to the data it creates a whole graphic and is sent through the API as a base64-uri ready to be consumed by the frontend client in the dashboard!!  [See repo](https://github.com/gabo-hacStyle/auth-backend.git)
4. **📋To-do Machine:** It serves as a simple to-do list manager that utilizes local storage for data persistence. Users can create new to-dos, mark them as completed, and delete unnecessary tasks.
