## 👨‍💻 Projects

Here you can see some of my favorite projects that I have worked on! 

1. 📚Academic Platform: This application is designed to manage courses, students, and users as an academic manager in an institution. It uses localStorage. Admin can create, edit and delete endpoints. [See more](https://academic-platform.vercel.app/) | [See repo](https://github.com/gabo-hacStyle/academic-platform)
2. 📋To-do Machine: It serves as a simple to-do list manager that utilizes local storage for data persistence. Users can create new to-dos, mark them as completed, and delete unnecessary tasks. [See more](https://gabo-hacstyle.github.io/to-do-machine/) | [See repo](https://github.com/gabo-hacStyle/to-do-machine) 
3. 👨🏻‍⚖️ Login/Register & Dashboard API: Backend built with django and django-rest-framework. The logic implemented is greatly adaptable for anyone ready to consume it. Users and data endpoints. Authentication, registration services already implemented. In this api thae data is auto-generated in the backend giing random values to a consecutive data --> according to the data it creates a whole graphic and shows it in the api as base64 image ready to consume in the frontend dashboard!!
