## 👨‍💻 Personal projects

Here you can see some of my favorite projects I have worked on! 

1. **📚⌚Historical Academic Platform:**
   Comprehensive data analysis platform for historical data of an academic institution, presented through a website deployed with Docker. This project brings together all the professional skills acquired over time. This is a fully responsive, accesible, and internationalized application. Like PowerBi, beautiful and organized charts of data are presented to three different roles of users accordingly. Executives can take actions based on reports that can be downloaded as PDF ditrectly from the web. Data is updated every week.

2. **📰 Dashboard:**
   A comprehensive dashboard for e-commerce. Its features can help you visualize data in a very practical way. Of course, is also responsive and supports light/dark themes. The application was built using React, ViteJS, and Tailwind CSS for styling. [See more](https://dashboard-app-psi-vert.vercel.app/) | [See repo](https://github.com/gabo-hacStyle/dashboard-app) 
3. **👨🏻‍⚖️ Login/Register & Dashboard API:**
   Backend built with django and django-rest-framework. Authentication and registration services for users have already been implemented. In this API, the data is auto-generated in the backend --> according to the data it creates a whole graphic and is sent through the API as a base64-uri ready to be consumed by the frontend client in the dashboard!!  [See repo](https://github.com/gabo-hacStyle/auth-backend.git)
4. **📋To-do Machine:**
   It serves as a simple to-do list manager that utilizes local storage for data persistence. Users can create new to-dos, mark them as completed, and delete unnecessary tasks. [See more](https://gabo-hacstyle.github.io/to-do-machine/) | [See repo](https://github.com/gabo-hacStyle/to-do-machine)
